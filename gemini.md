# Gemini Project: r404

## Vision

r404 is a castable web application designed to provide a seamless and visually engaging experience for browsing image-based content from Reddit. The core functionality of r404 is to fetch and display images from various Reddit feeds, including subreddits, multireddits, and RSS-liked pages, in a dynamic and aesthetically pleasing masonry layout.

The application is envisioned to be a "castable" page, meaning it can be easily cast to a larger screen, such as a TV, for a shared viewing experience. The user interface will be minimalist, focusing on the content itself. The primary interaction will involve a user providing a Reddit RSS link, from which the application will extract the necessary information to fetch and display the image feed.

## Key Features

*   **Masonry View:** Images will be displayed in a responsive masonry grid, ensuring an optimal viewing experience across different screen sizes and devices.
*   **RSS Feed Integration:** Users can input any valid Reddit RSS feed URL to view the corresponding image content.
*   **API Key Extraction:** The application will automatically extract the necessary pseudo-API key from the provided RSS link to access the Reddit API.
*   **Paged Content Loading:** The application will load content in pages, allowing for efficient and continuous browsing of large image feeds.
*   **Castable Interface:** The design and functionality will be optimized for casting to larger screens, providing a high-quality "screensaver" or "digital art" experience.
